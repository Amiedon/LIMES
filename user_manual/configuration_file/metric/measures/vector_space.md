# Vector Space Measures

LIMES supports comparing numeric vectors by using the vector space measures package consisting of the following measures:
 
 * `Euclidean` metric 
   - e.g. `euclidean(a.wgs84:lat|wgs84:long,b.wgs84:lat|wgs84:long)`
 * `Geo_Orthodromic` distance 
 * `Geo_Great_Elliptic` distance
